# odin-recipes
The current project is to create a basic recipe website.
By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated all of my HTML skills up until this point. These skills include writing boilerplate code from scratch, lists (both ordered and unordered), headings, paragraphs, images (with appropriate attributes), etc.
